# Deep-Learning-and-Restaurant-Reviews
Study best models for sentiment analysis of Restaurant Reviews

This project explores the effectiveness of transformer-based deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis in the context of restaurant reviews. The methodology involves fine-tuning three pre-trained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa v3) on a balanced dataset of 60,000 Yelp reviews. A fourth, tuned variant of DistilBERT was also assessed by modifying sequence length and batch size. All models were trained using an Adam optimizer and an early stopping protocol to ensure optimal generalization. The workflow includes preprocessing, followed by fine-tuning each model using a supervised learning approach. The models are assessed using standard classification metrics, with a particular focus on the F1-score to capture the balance between precision and recall.  Preliminary results show that hyperparameter tuning significantly influences model performance. Among the evaluated models, a tuned version of DistilBERT outperformed larger counterparts by achieving a favorable balance of accuracy and computational efficiency.
